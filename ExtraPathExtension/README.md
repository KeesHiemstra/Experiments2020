# ExtraPathExtension

I have TranslatePath() the string extension developed in
2018. I learned how to RegEx worked. 
E.g. folder "%OneDrive%\\Whatever.txt" is translated to
"C:\\Users\\CHi\\OneDrive\Whatever.txt". %OneDrive% is a
system (environment) variable.

This experiment SavePath() is developed to translate a 
folder to translate to a %OneDrive% folder.

E.g. "C:\\Users\\CHi\\OneDrive\Whatever.txt" is translated
to "%OneDrive%\\Whatever.txt".
