# ToDone

A to-do list is more than that only. Every day, week, 
month or year is also a leading event.

### Wishes

- [ ] A to-do can be related to certain day, like there is coffee-meeting on every Thursday. Not every week is there a need, sometimes there is reason. It can be helpful as a reminder thing.
- [ ] A to-do can have a related action.
